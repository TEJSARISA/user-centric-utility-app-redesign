# User-Centric Mobile Utility App Redesign (Concept)

Conceptual redesign of a mobile utility app focused on improving user retention and engagement by simplifying core workflows and reducing friction across the experience.

## Why this project matters

- Demonstrates end-to-end product thinking from problem framing to measurable UX impact.
- Shows skills across heuristic evaluation, user journey mapping, information architecture, and UI design.
- Aligns with large-scale consumer product work where small interaction improvements compound into retention and engagement gains.

## Problem

The original utility app had:

- Confusing navigation that forced users to hunt for primary actions.
- Long, multi-step flows for core tasks, causing drop-offs and incomplete sessions.
- Inconsistent visual hierarchy and feedback, making the experience feel unreliable.

Hypothesis: If the app is restructured around "ease of use" and streamlined task flows, users will complete their primary tasks faster, with fewer errors and less confusion, leading to better engagement and retention.

## Goals and success metrics

**Experience goals**

- Make the main task discoverable and usable within seconds.
- Reduce cognitive load on each screen through clearer hierarchy and copy.
- Provide consistent feedback and error handling to build trust.

**Success criteria (conceptual)**

- Reduce the number of steps in core workflows by ~30%.
- Decrease major usability issues found in heuristic evaluation.
- Improve perceived ease-of-use in quick user tests (self-reported ratings and task completion).

## Process

### 1. Research & Audit
- Conducted a heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielsen's heuristics (e.g., visibility of system status, match between system and real-world, error prevention).
- Mapped the end-to-end user journey for a primary task, identifying pain points at each stage.

### 2. Strategy & Design Principles
Defined design principles to guide decisions:
- "One clear primary action per screen."
- "Progressive disclosure over clutter."
- "Defaults that reduce input effort."
- "Clear system feedback for every critical action."

### 3. UX Design
- Reworked task flows to remove unnecessary steps and decisions.
- Created low-fidelity wireframes to validate navigation and information architecture.
- Iterated on flows before committing to visual design.

### 4. UI & Interaction Design
- Designed high-fidelity screens in Figma with a consistent component system.
- Defined patterns for empty states, confirmations, and error messages.
- Ensured accessible color contrast and tap targets appropriate for mobile.

### 5. Validation
- Ran quick usability walkthroughs with a small set of users/peers.
- Measured time-on-task and observed points of confusion to refine the flows.

## Key design decisions

### Home as a task hub
The home screen was redesigned to highlight the primary task with a single dominant call-to-action, supported by secondary shortcuts rather than competing actions.

### Streamlined core flow
The main workflow was reduced (for example, from 7 steps to 4) by:
- Combining related steps into a single screen when possible.
- Using smart defaults and previously entered information.
- Reducing mandatory inputs to only what is essential to complete the task.

### Clear navigation and hierarchy
Navigation was simplified to a small set of top-level destinations with clear labels. Visual hierarchy (typography, spacing, and color) was used to guide attention and reduce ambiguity.

### Consistent feedback and error handling
Introduced inline validation, clear success feedback, and non-blocking errors where possible, so users can correct issues without losing context.

## Outcomes (conceptual)

- Core workflow streamlined by approximately 30% fewer steps while maintaining feature completeness.
- Major heuristic violations around feedback and navigation were addressed through clearer structure and microcopy.
- Users in quick tests were able to complete the primary task faster and with less guidance compared to the original flow.

## Files in this repository

- `/case-study/` – detailed write-up with screenshots and annotations.
- `/research/` – heuristic evaluation notes and user journey maps.
- `/design/` – Figma exports (wireframes, high-fidelity screens, prototype link).
- `/metrics/` – before/after flow diagrams and step counts.

## Tools

- **Figma** for wireframes, UI and interactive prototype.
- **Whiteboarding / Diagramming** (FigJam, Miro) for user journeys and flow maps.

## How this relates to Meta

- Focuses on system-level design (flows, journeys, and heuristics) instead of isolated screens.
- Uses metrics and constraints (steps, time-on-task, severity of issues) to reason about impact.
- Reflects how small UX improvements across a utility experience can aggregate into better engagement and retention at scale.
